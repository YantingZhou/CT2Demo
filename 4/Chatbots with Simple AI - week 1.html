    <h1>BadCat Bot</h1>
    <p> This Discord bot is going to be an annoying and funny cat that asks yes or no questions and acts differently depending on the response. I think it will be a fun way to make decisions and pass the time.</p>
    <p>To use the bot, users will trigger it by typing a specific command in the Discord chat. The bot will then ask a series of yes or no questions related to the topic at hand. To make it more engaging, I'm going to add in emoji reactions and binary tree buttons, so users can respond with just a click.</p>
    <p>I want the BadCat Bot to have a playful and mischievous personality. It will use humor and sarcasm to interact with users and create a lighthearted atmosphere. </p>
